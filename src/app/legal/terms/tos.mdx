## Service Provisions and Specifications
NixLabs Networks offers a range of cloud computing services tailored to support various needs, from personal projects to enterprise-level solutions. Each service package, detailed on NixLabs Networks's website, includes specified allocations of memory, processing power, storage, and data transfer capabilities that users can select based on their requirements. Our network is designed for high performance, featuring low latency and high throughput, supported by robust infrastructure including multiple transit providers and backup power solutions to ensure consistent service uptime and reliability.


NixLabs Networks is dedicated to maintaining high-security standards by conducting regular updates and audits aimed at protecting the network and user data. We encourage users to employ strong security measures such as robust passwords and multi-factor authentication. Support for technical issues and service inquiries is available through our dedicated support team. Support requests are managed through our ticket system, which guarantees responses within predefined time frames to ensure timely and effective resolution of issues.

## Registration and Payments
To utilize the services of NixLabs Networks, registration and creation of an account are required. It is essential for users to provide accurate and current information during the registration process. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account information, including passwords, and are liable for all activities conducted under their account. In the event of unauthorized use or security breach, users must promptly notify NixLabs Networks. NixLabs Networks disclaims any liability for loss or damage resulting from the user's failure to secure their account information.


Billing is conducted on a monthly basis, and users must provide valid financial information related to their selected payment method during the account setup. This may include credit card details or other payment forms that are processed through third-party payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe. NixLabs Networks does not retain any financial data; all transactions are managed by the third-party processors, and users are subject to the terms and conditions of these processors.


Service modifications, including upgrades, can be requested through our support system. Due to technical limitations related to the operating system filesystems, direct downgrades of service packages are not supported. To obtain a smaller service package, users must purchase a new service, transfer their data manually, and cancel the original service to avoid double billing. Cancellations must be processed through the user dashboard or by contacting our support team, and they will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. This ensures that users can manage their service commitments and terminations effectively, without penalties or undue pressure.

## Technical Specifications and Limitations
Each service package from NixLabs Networks comes with predefined configurations of memory, virtual CPUs, SSD storage, and data transfer limits, which are comprehensively outlined during the selection process and accessible via the user dashboard. This allows users to choose a configuration that best suits their technical requirements and budget constraints.


NixLabs Networks assigns one IPv4 and one IPv6 address to each instance. Additional IPv6 addresses can be provided upon request through our support system to accommodate specific user needs. We also offer BGP session setup for users requiring this advanced networking feature, which involves a setup fee and the submission of a Letter of Intent (LOI) to verify the user’s authorization to announce specific IP addresses. Reverse DNS settings for IP addresses are user-manageable via the VPS control panel, allowing for immediate updates and modifications.

## Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability
NixLabs Networks provides its website and services on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the extent permitted by law, NixLabs Networks disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of intellectual property rights.


NixLabs Networks shall not be liable for any consequential, indirect, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use or inability to use the website or services. This includes, but is not limited to, losses or damages from service interruptions, data losses, or corruption that may occur during system failures, maintenance, or updates.

Despite our efforts to ensure reliability, NixLabs Networks does not warrant that the website will operate error-free or that the website and its servers are free of computer viruses or other harmful elements.

The limitation on liability is a critical element of the agreement between you and NixLabs Networks, reflecting the risk allocation between the parties. The provisions of this section apply to the fullest extent permitted by law, and survive any termination or expiration of your use of our services or the Terms of Service.


Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, NixLabs Networks's liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
